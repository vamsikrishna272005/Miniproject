# Title of the Project

Automated Food Quality Analysis Using Image Processing and Machine Learning

# Small Description

The Automated Food Quality Analysis system uses image processing and machine learning techniques to automatically assess the quality of food items. By analyzing visual features such as color, texture, and shape, the system helps in identifying fresh and spoiled food efficiently, reducing manual inspection time and human error.

# About

Automated Food Quality Analysis Using Image Processing and Machine Learning is a smart system designed to evaluate the quality of food products through digital images. Traditional food quality inspection methods rely heavily on manual checking, which can be time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to errors.

This project aims to overcome these limitations by using image processing techniques and machine learning models to analyze food images and classify them based on quality parameters such as freshness, ripeness, or spoilage. The system captures images of food items, preprocesses them, extracts important features, and uses trained models to predict food quality accurately. This solution can be effectively used in food industries, supermarkets, and quality control units.
